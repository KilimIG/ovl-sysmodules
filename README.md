# ovlSysmodule - ReiNX Support

A Tesla overlay that allows you to toggle sysmodules on the fly that now works on ReiNX

## Installation

Download the latest ovlSysmodules.ovl from the release page and drop it into the /switch/.overlays folder on your Switch's SD card

If a specific sysmodule does not work it is most likely missing the toolbox.json file in the /contents/ directory.
